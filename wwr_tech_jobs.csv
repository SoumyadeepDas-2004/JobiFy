 Ready to be a Titan? ServiceTitan is looking for an innovative Manager of Web Development who leads by example to join our Web Team. This hybrid player/coach role reports into the Director of Web Marketing and is designed for a leader who wants to stay technically grounded without being ""in the weeds"" 100% of the time. You will split your focus between hands-on technical contribution (working tickets, architectural design, code reviews) and formal people management (1:1s, career development, and team health for both Dev and QA) while leading the end-to-end development and optimization of our four flagship marketing websites:  www.servicetitan.com ,  www.youraspire.com ,  www.convex.com , and  www.fieldroutes.com . Our websites are critical to the user journey and serve as the engine for our overall pipeline generation program. We are seeking a strategic thinker who understands the unique nuances of high-performance marketing websites compared to SaaS products. If you are a proactive problem-solver who excels in a rapid-growth environment, this is the place for you. What You'll Do: Technical Contribution  Strategic Coding:  Rather than high-volume daily tasks, you will focus on high-impact tickets, complex bug fixes, or foundational architectural work. Code Quality & Reviews:  Act as the final line of defense for code quality. You will perform critical PR reviews and ensure that QA and Dev are tightly integrated. Technical Unblocking:  Identify technical debt or workflow bottlenecks that slow the team down and get hands-on to resolve them. Innovation & Support:  Proactively identify and champion the adoption of new technologies (including AI integration) while providing ongoing support for existing features and security patches. Project Leadership:  Operate as a Technical Lead, successfully launching and completing multiple large-scale technical projects simultaneously while impacting the immediate team's success. Vendor Management:  Take the lead on working with third-party vendors for various integrations, ensuring seamless connectivity across our marketing stack.  Technical Architecture:  Lead the technical design and implementation of significant features that span multiple components, ensuring code quality, scalability, and adherence to best practices. Process Improvement:  Develop and implement technical process improvements, such as advanced CI/CD strategies and new coding standards, to be adopted across the team. People & Team Leadership  Lead and Manage:  Serve as the direct people manager for our team of Web Developers and QA Engineers, fostering a culture of technical excellence and continuous growth. Growth & Performance:  Conduct regular 1:1s focused on both tactical output and long-term career progression. You will own performance reviews and compensation conversations. Team Dynamics:  Actively manage interpersonal relationships and team culture. You are responsible for building a cohesive, high-trust environment across the Dev and QA disciplines. Resource Planning:  Work with the Director of Web Marketing to balance team capacity with roadmap ambitions, ensuring the team is challenged but not burned out. What You’ll Bring: Balanced Perspective:  You understand that ""winning"" means the team is shipping great software, not just that you personally finished a ticket. Technical Empathy:  Because you still push code, you have a realistic pulse on the codebase, which informs how you manage deadlines and individual performance. Mentorship Mindset:  You enjoy the challenge of coaching a QA engineer on automation strategy just as much as helping a developer optimize a database query. Management & Soft Skills:  Excellent communication and collaboration skills with a proven ability to manage direct reports and influence cross-functional stakeholders. Problem Solving:  Strong ability to troubleshoot complex, cross-service technical challenges and identify root causes rather than surface-level issues. Architecture Knowledge:  Advanced understanding of system architecture, distributed systems, and performance optimization for highly available applications. Modern Stack Experience:  High level of confidence with static site generators (Gatsby JS, Next JS), Node JS, and headless CMS platforms like Contentful. Technical Expertise:  Deep proficiency in front-end technologies (HTML5, CSS3, TypeScript, JavaScript) and frameworks like React JS and TailwindCSS. Standards & Compliance:  Solid knowledge of WCAG accessibility standards, SEO best practices, and secure coding principles. Tools of the Trade:  Proven experience with TDD, Gitflow, automated E2E testing, and cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, or GCP). QA & Automation Experience:  Familiarity with QA automation tools and processes strongly preferred. Educational Background:  Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Web Development, or a related field (or equivalent work experience). Be Human With Us: Being human isn’t about checking every box on a list. It’s about the experiences we have, people we meet, and the perspectives we share. So, if you have the skills but are hesitant to apply because of your background, apply anyway. We need amazing people like you to help us challenge the conventional and think differently about the problems that we’re solving. We’re in this together. Come be human, with us.  What We Offer: When you join our team, you’re not just accepting a job. You’re making a career move. Here’s how we’ll support you in doing some of the most impactful work of your career: Flextime, recognition, and support for autonomous work:  Flexible time off with ample learning and development opportunities to continue growing your career. We offer a comprehensive onboarding program, leadership training for Titans at all levels, and other programs and events. Great work is rewarded through Bonusly, peer-nominated awards, and more. Holistic health and wellness benefits : Company-paid medical, dental, and vision (with 100% employer paid options and 90% coverage for dependents),  FSA  and  HSA , 401k match, and telehealth options including memberships to One Medical.

 Help shape how we work by suggesting process improvements, tools, or approaches as we scale.

 A self-starter who’s excited to take initiative, ask questions, and figure things out independently. 
 Customer-obsessed: you love solving real problems for real people. 
 Collaborative by nature—you make others around you better. 
 Strong communicator who can write clearly and concisely. 
 Comfortable with ambiguity and energized by wearing multiple hats. 
 Technically curious—you don’t need to be an engineer, but you enjoy learning how things work. 
 
 What You’ll Need 
 
 2–3 years of experience in product management or a related role in a tech company. 
 Experience working with cross-functional teams and managing product development cycles. 
 Demonstrated ability to ship something—whether a feature, tool, process, or product. 
 Bonus: you’ve worked at a startup, or deeply understand startup mentality and pace. 
 
 Why Join Us 
 
 Work with a kind, smart, and ambitious team that values outcomes over egos. 
 Fully remote and async-first—trust and autonomy are our defaults. 
 Opportunity to grow quickly and take on more responsibility. 
 Competitive compensation, flexible hours, and real work-life balance.

For coaches, YouTubers, authors, podcasters, and other creatives, there isn't a better marketing hub to rely on to grow audiences, automate email marketing, and sell digital products — all within one platform.  More importantly, there isn't a team more committed to helping creators earn a living. We're on a mission to help creators earn $1 billion using our creator marketing platform. We have always been 100% independent and 100% remote. We are proud to have built a product that our customers love, and we look for people who have enthusiasm and belief in our mission, vision, and values to join our team. We're also embracing AI thoughtfully — both in how we build and how we hire to ensure our team is adaptable, innovative, and ready for what's next. The role Growth at Kit isn't a side function - it's core to our product strategy. We're looking for a  Senior Product Growth Manager  to drive high-impact growth initiatives across activation, monetization, and expansion that help creators succeed faster and more predictably. This role is about building durable growth systems that compound over time, not one-off tactics. You'll own key growth surfaces end-to-end - from identifying opportunities to shipping experiments to scaling what works. This is a full-time senior IC role ideal for someone who thrives on measurable impact, enjoys hypothesis-driven experimentation, and is excited to shape how growth systems work at a scaling company.  Your support system You'll report to  Katie Swett Miller , our Chief Product Officer and collaborate closely with Engineering, Design, Data, Marketing, and Lifecycle teams. You'll partner across functions to ensure alignment between product experiences and go-to-market efforts, while having access to a peer group of Product Managers across Kit for support and mentorship.   What you'll do First Week:  Dive into Kit's product ecosystem, growth metrics dashboards, and current experimentation framework. Attend Get-To-Know-You (GTKY) meetings with cross-functional partners. Get access and learn key tools like Linear, Mixpanel, Omni, and our experimentation platform. First Month:  Analyze onboarding flows and activation funnels to understand current conversion patterns. Review past experiments and their outcomes.

Lead hypothesis-driven tests that reduce friction in key workflows. Partner with Data to establish clear success metrics and translate insights into product decisions. Successfully improve a core growth metric (activation, conversion, or expansion). First Year:  Drive measurable improvement across Kit's growth funnel through systematic experimentation and scaled solutions. Build durable growth systems that contribute meaningfully to Kit's 2025 revenue target and our long-term vision of $100,000,000 ARR from 250,000 creators.

We work mostly on East Coast time—so if you're based on the West Coast of the United States, Europe, or Asia, you might have a few early mornings or late evenings.

 Senior Software Engineers at Stamped are hands-on builders responsible for designing, developing, and delivering high-quality software that powers our products. This role combines technical depth with product intuition — engineers are expected to think like product partners, not just implementers. 
 They work closely with Product and the Director of Engineering to rapidly prototype, validate, and scale solutions that drive measurable user value. Senior Engineers bring curiosity, empathy, and a bias for action, leveraging AI tools and modern practices to deliver with speed, reliability, and craftsmanship. 
 This role has a strong emphasis on user-facing development — building intuitive, performant interfaces and components that merchants interact with daily. While full-stack capability is valued, you'll spend significant time on front-end architecture, UI implementation, and ensuring excellent user experiences across our product suite. 
 Our current systems include a large .NET/C# foundation on the backend, so familiarity with these technologies is helpful for full-stack collaboration, but your primary focus will be o modern front-end development and the user experience layer. 
 This group sits at the center of Stamped's shift toward an AI-native, iterative engineering culture — emphasizing autonomy, accountability, and shared ownership across the team. 
 Responsibilities 
 
 Product Engineering:  Design, build, test, and ship user-facing features with a focus on polish, performance, and usability. 
 Front-End Development:  Build and maintain responsive, accessible UI components and interfaces using modern frameworks and tooling. 
 Prototyping & Validation:  Rapidly prototype new user experiences to validate value before scaling. 
 AI-Enabled Development:  Use AI tools (e.g., Copilot, Claude, or similar) to accelerate development, reduce repetitive work, and improve code quality. 
 Technical Judgment : Participate in front-end architecture decisions, component design patterns, and client-side performance optimization. Contribute to discussions on full-stack integration and API design. 
 Execution & Ownership:  Deliver against roadmap commitments with a focus on quality, maintainability, and iteration — especially on user-facing surfaces. 
 Collaboration:  Partner closely with Product and the Director of Engineering to align technical work with customer and business needs. Work alongside designers to ensure high-fidelity implementation of user experiences. 
 Knowledge Sharing:  Document, mentor, and contribute to a culture of learning and openness. 
 Continuous Improvement:  Stay curious and experimental with new tools, frameworks, and AI workflows that can improve speed, quality, or developer experience. 
 
 
 Requirements 
 
 
 5+ years of professional software engineering experience, with significant time spent on front-end or full-stack development 
 Strong proficiency with modern JavaScript/TypeScript and front-end framework (React, Vue, or similar) — experience building scalable, maintainable component architectures 
 Experience with responsive design, accessibility standards, and client-side performance optimization 
 Familiarity with backend technologies and APIs — experience with C#/.NET, Node.js, Python, or similar is a plus for full-stack collaboration 
 Experience with cloud infrastructure (AWS preferred) 
 Demonstrated use of AI tools or automation in the development workflow 
 Product mindset: comfort with ambiguity, iteration, and user-centric decision-making 
 Excellent communication and collaboration skills; thrive in cross-functional teams

 The goal of search engine optimization is to increase a website’s discoverability. In recent years, the act of consumer discovery occurs across an increasingly diverse collection of interfaces. 
 The Optimization Specialist at ONeil Interactive is responsible for working in concert with the Optimization Manager – maximizing discoverability for all potential origins: search engines, generative engines, listing engines, and beyond. 
 Who the Optimization Specialist is: 
 
 You are endlessly curious; naturally metabolizing uncertainty into energy.  The uncharted nature of SEO does not discourage you. It motivates you. 
 You aim to be correct, but you are not paralyzed by a fear of being wrong.  You dig deeper, relentlessly exploring beyond the surface in pursuit of a more perfect answer. 
 You do not seek to know things, but to understand the nature of those things  — the how and why. 
 You’re seeking a workplace where big egos are forbidden and high performance is required.  Your aim is nothing short of excellence in your field, and you want co-workers that are equally driven. You are eager to learn and eager to teach. 
 You have a deep understanding of the internet, websites, and technology in general.  You know your blindspots, but you also know how to fill those gaps with research. You don’t hesitate to seek the counsel of colleagues. 
 You communicate with humble confidence.  You do not fear questions. You’ve already asked yourself the same questions others are likely to ask. You are not offended when your ideas are respectfully challenged. 
 You present reports and recommendations with an honest clarity, adapting technical topics to meet your audience’s acumen.  Your conclusions are supported by data, but your message centers the story the data tells. 
 You have a bias toward action.  You believe that “done” is better than “perfect.” 
 You have a black belt in spreadsheet formulas.  Data visualization is your happy place. 
 You’re a vociferous reader and cautious consumer of emerging SEO trends.  You know how to identify credible information and filter out the scams. You evolve and adapt as needed. 
 You don’t wait to be asked.  You proactively identify opportunities and needs, then come prepared with well-researched solutions to fill them. 
 You deliver a consistent degree of dependability and quality.  You understand that excellence is a habit, not an act, especially when serving clients. 
 
 Example Activities in the Day-to-Day Role 
 
 Website audits: Defining, executing, evaluating, and presenting. 
 Advising clients to ensure they understand the SEO strategies tailored to their specific websites. 
 Creating Looker Studio reports that visualize comprehensive performance data. 
 Leading the (virtual) meetings with optimization clients. 
 Setting performance benchmarks and KPIs for ongoing evaluation. 
 Identifying, investigating, and resolving technical SEO issues related to indexing, Core Web Vitals, traffic data, event collection, and site performance. 
 Contributing to content strategy development and creating content to support SEO goals. 
 Researching and resourcing data from credible sources to develop effective strategies.

 We’re on a scale-up journey, and we’re seeking people who thrive in this stage. We want Float to be the place where you have the autonomy and opportunity to do the best work of your career. 
   
 Why We’re Hiring For This Role 
 At Float, we’re committed to supporting our customers with care while scaling sustainably. As part of that journey, we’re expanding our focus on retention within our VSMB and SMB customer segments, and are committed to building systems that deliver value at scale without sacrificing the personal experience. 
 This role leads that charge. As our first Customer Success Manager fully focused on a digital-first model, you’ll shape and deliver one-to-many programs, build proactive engagement strategies, and drive consistent customer outcomes across a high-volume segment. It’s a critical role at a pivotal moment, and is designed to strengthen retention, amplify impact, and help Float evolve toward a smarter, scalable model of customer success. 
 We’re looking for someone based in the AMER region (North, Central, or South America!), so that we can ensure our one-to-many programs can support our client base. That said, you’ll be working asynchronously with a bright, dedicated team from across the globe, with a strong focus on taking complex problems and creating solutions that feel simple and intuitive for our customers. 
 Our Director of Customer Success, Emily, explains the important role you will play within our Customer Success team.  Watch this video! 
   
 What You’ll Be Responsible For 
 Early on, you’ll jump right into: 
 
 Developing product and customer expertise:  You’ll work on learning and developing working knowledge of Float’s product, customer journey, and existing success strategies to confidently support SMB customers across regions and understand areas of opportunity. 
 Manage SMB customer portfolio:  Own a book of 3500+ SMB customers, maintaining high-level oversight, and making improvements to existing systems and workflows. 
 Map and baseline retention metrics:  Deliver a clear, documented view of current retention performance, and identify automation opportunities to improve renewals at scale. 
 
 Once you are a bit more settled, we expect that you will jump into the following areas of ownership: 
 
 Building and implementing automations:  Collaborate with your team to design and operationalize a system for managing the VSMB/SMB segments: segmenting accounts by lifecycle stage, engagement level, and renewal risk for consistent tracking and follow-up. 
 Lead scaled customer programs:  Drive adoption and retention by running one-to-many initiatives such as webinars, group trainings, and automated lifecycle campaigns. 
 Own digital onboarding for new VSMB SMB customers:  Managing digital-touch onboarding for customers in North America and APAC, ensuring a smooth post-sales experience and early success milestones. 
 Refine automation and playbooks:  Use customer data and feedback to optimize engagement strategies, continuously improving efficiency and outcomes. 
 
   
 What You’ll Need To Be Successful 
 We want you to love your work and believe that these skills will allow you to succeed in the role. Applying these skills requires: 
 
 SMB expertise:  Deep understanding of the needs, behaviors, and business rhythms of very small and small-to-medium-sized businesses, with experience managing large volumes of VSB/VSMB accounts. 
 Churn management:  Proven ability to proactively identify risk and execute strategies to retain accounts and reduce churn across a high-volume book of business. 
 Scaled program delivery:  Experience designing, managing, and optimizing automations and one-to-many engagement strategies across a globally dispersed customer base. 
 Customer retention:  Strong track record of driving long-term customer value through targeted retention initiatives and scalable success programs. 
 Clear communicator:  Confident and articulate written and verbal communicator, capable of explaining technical concepts in a simple, relatable way to a non-technical audience. 
 Webinar & content delivery:  Comfortable preparing, recording, and hosting live or pre-recorded sessions for one-to-many formats, including webinars and onboarding content. 
 
 As a fully remote team, we’re looking for someone comfortable with asynchronous communication as the default, which means you have previous remote experience and are comfortable using tools like Slack, Loom, and Linear to communicate as needed. 
 Why Join Us 
 On target earnings for this role is OTE US $120,163 (Level 3), structured as a 90:10 split between base:variable. 
 Here’s a  blog post  with more information on how we determine our salaries.

 Using AI? A Quick Note. 
 We know that tools like ChatGPT are part of how many of us work today (us too!). Feel free to use AI to support your writing, but don’t let it do the talking for you.

 An overview of this role 
 You'll lead the Core Planning team within GitLab's Plan stage, reimagining how development teams organize, coordinate, and plan their work at enterprise scale. Right now, planning is fragmented—teams juggle issues, epics, and tickets while struggling to connect their daily work to business outcomes. You'll solve this by building flexible, configurable planning fundamentals that replace outdated agile mechanisms with intelligent automation. Your focus will be on evolving our work item model, integrating agentic AI functionality that handles repetitive planning tasks, and freeing up teams to focus on what matters: strategy, intent, and delivery. You'll report to a Group Manager of Product, working closely with product design and engineering leadership to define planning for a modern, AI-powered world. In your first year, you'll reshape the core planning experience that millions of developers across 100,000+ GitLab customers will rely on—transforming how teams think about planning, not as a burden, but as an intelligent partner in their success. 
 What you’ll do 
 
 Lead the Core Planning team's vision and strategy, guiding GitLab's shift from traditional agile planning mechanics toward enterprise-ready planning fundamentals that empower teams to organize, coordinate, and execute work more effectively 
 Own the product strategy for work items—simplifying the fragmented landscape of issues, epics, and tickets into a configurable, unified primitive that scales across organizations of any size 
 Drive the integration of agentic AI functionalities into planning workflows, replacing manual planning tasks with intelligent automation while ensuring trustworthiness and reliability for end users 
 Collaborate cross-functionally with engineering, design, and product teams to understand developer and engineering manager needs, translating them into products that improve team coordination and workflow 
 Define how planning connects to business outcomes, helping teams understand the ROI of their work and make data-driven capacity and cycle-time decisions 
 Co-shape the product's approach to managing context and knowledge, ensuring critical business information and specifications flow seamlessly through the development lifecycle 
 Partner with the Knowledge & Context and Project Management teams within Plan stage to balance responsibilities and eliminate redundancy as the planning experience evolves in the SDLC 
 
 What you’ll bring 
 
 Experience building or shipping products for SaaS, DevOps, or DevSecOps platforms, or working in scale-ups in adjacent spaces 
 Working knowledge of software development and familiarity with how development teams organize and coordinate their work 
 Demonstrated ability to collaborate closely with engineering teams and use data and metrics to inform product decisions 
 Comfort learning quickly in new domains and adapting your approach and decision making based on new information, rather than relying primarily on past patterns 
 Track record of picking things up efficiently and getting productive in new product areas or organizations without extended onboarding periods 
 A mindset that values fresh perspectives and questioning existing approaches, even if you've worked in related spaces before 
 Experience working in distributed or remote environments, or collaborating with teams across different regions and time zones with excellent verbal and written communication skills. 
 
 About the team 
 The Plan stage is reimagining how development teams organize, coordinate, and execute their work. The Core Planning team you'll lead is at the heart of this transformation, owning the foundational workflows and mechanics that enable teams to plan effectively at scale. Working closely with engineering partners and product designers, your team is responsible for simplifying how work items (issues, epics, and tickets) are configured and coordinated, while simultaneously building trustworthy AI-powered agentic functionalities that free humans from repetitive planning tasks so they can focus on strategy and intent. You'll be tackling some of the most interesting challenges in DevOps: moving teams beyond traditional agile estimation guessing games toward real data-driven capacity planning, connecting business outcomes to actual team velocity, and scaling planning workflows across organizations with hundreds of developers. The team operates asynchronously across distributed regions and collaborates closely with engineering (led by your EM counterpart), design, and the broader Plan stage initiatives focused on knowledge management and intelligent automation. This is an opportunity to shape how millions of developers work together, replacing manual, repetitive planning mechanics with intelligent systems that amplify human decision-making.

 - Do you see crappy products everywhere and think ""I could make that so much better""? 
 - Does your brain refuse to stop solving problems, even when you're supposed to be relaxing? 
 - Do you thrive in a high-stress environment filled with political infighting, bureaucracy, and corporate nonsense? 
   
 If so, then we are the place for you, except you might hate how nice of a company we have - filled with happy, generally competent people that don’t put up with jerks. Frankly, it makes me sick how nice everyone is. 
   
 We are remote full time, have very flexible hours, people are judged by their output, not by how much they suck up to the boss, and turnover is super low because the company believes that happy employees = happy customers = happy bank account. Simply disgusting, if you ask me. 
   
 --Is this a real job ad?-- 
 Yup! Amazingly enough, we actually paid money to post this on a bunch of different job sites. And it’s not even a pyramid scheme! Plus, get this: the owner just started paying our 70ish employees with money instead of Pizza Hut coupons - we’re big time, people. 
   
 Our careers page is actually worth checking out to learn more about how insane we are (sidenote: it won a web design award in 1993 - we’re a pretty big deal): 
   
 http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/ 
   
 And check out our reviews on  Google ,  Glassdoor , or  Indeed  to see that it’s not just the founder’s mother who says we’re cool. 
   
 --What do you guys do?-- 
 We do a lot of different things these days including selling awesome consumer products (these are just a small sampling):  
   
 - Bad Parking Cards ( https://amz.run/5Eya ) 
 - Beverage Barricades ( https://amz.run/6kip ) 
 - Child Chucker ( https://amz.run/9EUz ) 
   
 Running this Amazon Pay-Per-Click agency: PPCFarm.com (we’re really, really good at PPC) 
   
 And we will soon be launching a SaaS product for inventory management. 
   
 We are doing our best to grow rapidly every year, and it’s our intention to continue that for as long as possible, which means we need good people to help us keep up with the growth. 
   
 --What is your company like?-- 
 1. You Can Be Yourself. You don’t have to put on a fake, professional face. You can just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO (highly encouraged), and no one will think anything of it. You don't have to dress up, or use formal language, or pretend to be something you're not - you can just be you. 
   
 2. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a small business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn’t matter what your credentials are – it matters what you get done. 
   
 3. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your pajamas, on your schedule. And we don’t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a week or 6 hours a day and catch up over the weekend. So long as you get a lot of work done, we’re happy campers. 
   
 4. Complete Work/Life Balance. If you’re routinely working more than 45ish hours, you’re gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at 100% capacity, which means that you need to rest. 
   
 5. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way of getting work done. 
   
 6. No Micro-Management. Once you’re trained and have demonstrated you know your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren’t the place for you. 
   
 7. No Toxic/Incompetent People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean or stupid people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire them quickly. You will never have to interact with someone who is an obvious idiot or straight up malicious. No toxic or incompetent people at work - could it really be? [Yes] 
   
 8. Supportive Environment. We don’t operate via intense stress or unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful – internal politics are at a minimum here. 
   
 9. Lots of Raises. We do our absolute best to get ahead of things and give raises preemptively, so you don't have to ask for one. It's not unusual at all for someone to receive 2+ raises per year. 
   
 10. We’ll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better constantly. You’ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier. 
   
 11. 4-6+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of time off is absolutely worth it. 
   
 12. Paid Maternity/Paternity Leave. We’ve even started letting people skip meetings during labor! 
   
 13. Self-Funded So We Can Do What’s Right for Us. We don’t have to answer to anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease some selfish investor. 
   
 --What are your company’s values?-- 
 See here:  http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/ 
   
 Yes, those are legitimately our values. The careers page is definitely worth checking out - it’s not just normal corporate BS. We promise you’ll learn a lot about us. 
   
 --OK, so I’ve read like 8 dang pages about you guys. Will you tell me what the actual job is?-- 
 No. 
   
 --Wait... What?-- 
 OK fine. Super short version: 
   
 Inventing remarkable consumer products - taking concepts from ""this should exist"" to ""holy shit, why didn't this exist before"" - in the kitchen and household space. 
 Bulleted Responsibilities: 
 
 
 Take product concepts and figure out how to make them work elegantly 
 
 
 Design products in CAD (we use SolidWorks, but we're flexible on software) 
 
 
 Prototype heavily in-house (3D printing, testing, breaking, improving, repeat) 
 
 
 Iterate relentlessly until the product hits our ""remarkable"" quality threshold 
 
 
 Collaborate with our supply chain team on Design for Manufacturing and sourcing decisions 
 
 
 Deliver production-ready CAD files and specifications for manufacturing 
 
 
 Solve hard problems that don't have obvious solutions (this is like 80% of the job) 
 
 
 To give you an idea of what we make: Beverage Barricades (the magnetic drink guard), CrocoDicer, and various kitchen gadgets that make people's lives meaningfully better. We're not making generic private label crap - we're inventing things that are genuinely novel and patentable. 
 Fair warning: this is slow, deliberate work. A single product might take 6-36 months from concept to launch. We are quality-obsessed and refuse to ship mediocre products. If you need the dopamine hit of shipping something every week, you will be miserable here. 
 Like everyone else in the company, you will also need to innovate regularly - which means figuring out ways to improve quality and production speed. 
   
 It is challenging, but fun work that’s going to require a lot of time and task management, problem-solving, and a reasonable amount of people skills. 
   
 --Do I need a college degree?-- 
 You just need to be awesome. 
   
 --Are there any geographic restrictions?-- 
 As long as you are in a country that doesn’t have active sanctions from the US government, we are interested. Our founder isn’t known for respecting the government much, but they have all the guns, so… 
   
 --Do I need an engineering degree?-- 
 Nope. Our current product engineer is largely self-taught and didn't go to engineering school. We don't care about credentials - we care about whether you can actually invent great products. If you can demonstrate strong CAD skills and a track record of making things, that matters way more than a diploma. 
   
 --What CAD software do you use?-- 
 We currently use SolidWorks, but we're not religious about it. What matters is that you can produce production-ready 3D models. If you're proficient in Fusion 360, AutoCAD, or similar - that's fine. Just know that you'll need to come in with strong 3D modeling skills; we're not training from zero. 
   
 --How many products will I work on at once?-- 
 Typically 1-2 at a time. This is deep focus work, not juggling a dozen things. You'll spend months on a single product, iterating until it's genuinely great. 
   
 --What if I've never worked in consumer products before?-- 
 That's fine, as long as you have demonstrated ability to design and prototype physical products. Whether that came from industrial design, mechanical engineering, or just being a maker who builds stuff in your garage - we care about the skill, not the pedigree. 
   
 --Do I need to deal with manufacturers directly?-- 
 You'll collaborate with our supply chain team on Design for Manufacturing and be involved in sourcing decisions, but you won't own the vendor relationships. Supply chain handles the day-to-day communication with factories. Your job is to design products that can actually be manufactured. 
   
 --What does a typical day look like?-- 
 Variable as hell. Some days you're deep in CAD. Some days you're running prototype tests. Some days you're researching materials or competitor products. Very few meetings. Basically no bureaucracy. What's consistent is working independently, solving hard problems, and pushing toward ""remarkable."" 
   
 --6-36 months per product? Really?-- 
 Really. We iterate until it's genuinely great. We'd rather take 2 years to launch something remarkable than rush out something mediocre in 3 months. If that timeline makes you anxious, this probably isn't the role for you. 
   
 --What types of products will I be working on?-- 
 Primarily kitchen and household products. Things that solve real problems people have. We're especially interested in products that can be patented and are hard for competitors to copy. Generally, we want to either radically improve a product in its category (like 200% better) or invent a new category. 
   
 --This sounds pretty good, though I’m still skeptical that this isn’t a pyramid scheme.-- 
 You sound just like the tax authorities! 
   
 --That doesn’t resolve any of my fears, but what do I need to do to apply?-- 
 Please submit your information on the following page to apply. We promise to respond within 5-10 business days even if our answer is No. 
   
 There will be multiple steps in this process, FYI, including a long written application, interviews with potentially a few different people, and paid work test(s). Hiring the right people is really hard and very expensive if we do it poorly, so we have to front-load the process. I'm sorry about that and thank you for sticking with us. 
   
 Once you’re in our pipeline though, I would anticipate giving you a final answer within a few weeks, depending on how it goes. We definitely don’t want to string you along, and as long as you do what we ask, we promise to tell you “yes” or “no”, and to not just ghost you (like everybody I match with on Tinder). 
   
 Thank you for your time and interest, and I hope we can work together soon!

 About Us 
 Close  is a bootstrapped, profitable, 100% remote, ~100 person team of thoughtful individuals who prioritize taking ownership and making a meaningful impact. We’re eager to make a product our customers fall in love with over and over again. 
   
 We 💛 small scaling businesses. Since 2013, we’ve been building a CRM that focuses on better communication, without the hassle of manual data entry or a complex UI. We are out to supercharge sales productivity with the most modern, thoughtfully designed, all-in-one, communication-focused CRM.  
   
 Our backend  tech stack  consists primarily of Python Flask web apps with our  TaskTiger  scheduler handling many of the backend asynchronous task processing chores. Our data stores include MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, and Redis. The underlying infrastructure runs on AWS using a combination of managed services like EKS, MSK, RDS and ElasticCache and non-managed services running on EC2 instances. We have CI/CD pipelines that build Docker images, run automated tests and deploy to Kubernetes clusters. We also use these images in our local development environment allowing coding locally against all of our services. We have a well-documented  public API  that is consumed by our front-end JavaScript app as well as numerous integrations. Our infrastructure is heavily automated using Terraform, Ansible and other AWS tools. 
   
 Our product development process is inspired by  Shape Up . We love open sourcing our code and ideas on  our GitHub  and on  The Making of Close , our behind-the-scenes Product & Engineering blog. Check out our open source projects like  SocketShark ,  TaskTiger ,  LimitLion  and  ciso8601 .

 Mobena is a three-person, remote-first startup building the “evolution” of multi-generational tax/estate planning software, targeting the advisors of America’s 2 million wealthiest families. We’re currently hiring our first dedicated UI Engineer to “own” the frontend of our flagship product, Mobena Evolution, for which we have little to no frontend code. You’ll work directly with our backend/algorithm-focused CTO, as well as our designer-founder, to turn evolving Figma concepts into fast, maintainable, and scalable user interfaces. 
 What You’ll Do 
 
 Choose and justify the frameworks and tools that best fit our needs. 
 
 We have some holdover prototype code in Vite JS, but you can take it or leave it; all of our Figma concepts are new. 
 The backend is a standard HTTP API. We are open to everything from established web stacks (React, Angular, Svelte, Vite) to cross-platform or native solutions (Qt, WASM, .NET MAUI, Tauri, Electron, Tk)—literally anything, if you can convince us it’s the right choice. 
 
 Build our UI from the ground up, establishing clear, maintainable patterns for components, state management, styling, testing, performance, and accessibility. 
 Collaborate to refine and sometimes re-frame existing screen designs in Figma. 
 Connect the frontend to our APIs (REST, GraphQL, or similar). 
 Lay groundwork for future mobile clients; however, experience in this regard is a plus rather than a requirement. 
 
 About You 
 
 You’ve shipped an interactive application—web, desktop, or mobile—via coursework, open source, side project or professional work. 
 You care about usability and design quality. (That is, you care about the user.) 
 You learn by  doing:  building things rather than sitting in committee. 
 You are happy to say  I don’t know.  We try to cultivate  “beginner’s mind”  at Mobena—it helps us avoid conventional traps and groupthink. The first step of thinking like a beginner is acknowledging your own ignorance! 😊 
 You can defend your technical choices in clear English, and can take credit for your successes as well your mistakes. 
 You are comfortable in an early-stage, collaborative environment.
